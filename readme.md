Make a to-do app!

It can be as creative or simple as you would like... but we'd recommend simple. (Our solution doesn't even have CSS.)

Here are some things the instructors have written that may be helpful:
- [Angular Gotchas](https://github.com/ga-wdi-lessons/angular-review/blob/master/angular-gotchas.md)
